    <string name="des">The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) is a multilateral development bank established in 1975, headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Its main goal is to foster economic development and social progress in its 57 member countries, most of which are from the Muslim world, but it also supports Muslim communities in non-member countries. The bank follows Shariah principles, so all its financing is interest-free and based on Islamic finance methods such as profit-sharing, leasing, and equity participation.</string>
